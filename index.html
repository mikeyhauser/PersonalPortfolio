        <h2 id="mechanical">Mechanical: I Can Fix That Engine!</h2>
        <p>For over a decade I have repaired engines, both diesel and gasoline, in an array of industries. From agricultural and trucking equipment in Orange County, NC, to buses and tourism boats in the Galapagos Islands, the world of mechanical repair has been kind in providing me with a myriad of opportunity to disassemble equipment and fix it. Whether in the field or in a workshop, every mechanical breakdown is a valuable chance to plumb the depths of critical thinking. I owe every shattered bearing my gratitude for connecting me in the web of society.</p>

        <p>
          I have started on a path as a computer programmer by pursuing both a degree in computer science and a coding bootcamp. This Professional Portfolio page you are currently navigating is constructed with HTML and CSS. It is the first project I have created from scratch in the coding bootcamp. The code for this projects is linked below through the images.

        <h2 id="woodworking">For The Love Woodworking!</h2>
        <p>After a year and a half of designing and building my own house, people around me have noticed that I have a natural ability to work wood. I enjoy taking fallen trees or old wood and using tools to make them into furniture, geometric shapes, or custom trim for a house. If you have some fancy wood youâ€™d like to incorporate into a creative project, share that dream with me and the chances are I have the tools and skills to make it happen!</p>
